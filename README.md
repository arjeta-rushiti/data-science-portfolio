# Data Science Portfolio
<hr>

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes.<br> 
Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

**Tools:**

 - **Python:** NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
 - **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras

### Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally

1. Install dependencies using *requirements.txt* <br>
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server
